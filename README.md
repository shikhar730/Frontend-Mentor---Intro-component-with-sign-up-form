## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

- Responsive CSS
- HTML Forms
- Form Validation

### Useful resources

- [Client-side form validation-MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - This helped me in understanding the in-built form validation using html and The Constraint Validation API in Javascript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
